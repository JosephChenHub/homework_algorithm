\section{Problem Reduction}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Description:} 
		\begin{enumerate}[I.] 
		 \item construct a graph network with each item of the matrix
		 $M[i][j]$ as a vertex $v_{i,j}$,
		 add edges from $v_{i,j}$ to $v_{i+1,j}$ and
		 $v_{i, j+1}$.Set the capacity $C(u\rightarrow w) = 1$
		 and cost $W(u\rightarrow v_{i,j}) = M[i][j]$,
		 let $v_{1,1} = s,v_{m,n} = t$.
		\item apply minimum cost algorithm (Klen algorithm ) with flow $v = 2$, the sum of cost is minimum.
		\end{enumerate} 
		\begin{algorithm}[H]
			\caption{MinCost}
			\begin{algorithmic}[1]
				\Require  Matrix $M_{ij}$ with number that means the costs when walk through a certain point
				\Ensure   A flow $f$ that contains two path from $s$ to  $t$ without intersection
				\Function {MinCost} {M}
				\State construct a network $G$ as discribed above
				\State $f$ = Ford-Fulkerson($G$)
				\While {$G_f$ has a negatibe circle $C$}
					\State $b$ = bottleneck($C$)
					\State $\hat{f}$ is the unit flow of $C$
					\State $f = f + b\hat{f}$
				\EndWhile 
				\State\Return $f$
				\EndFunction 
			\end{algorithmic} 
		\end{algorithm}			
		
	\item \textbf{Correctness:} \\
	 \begin{itemize}
	 	\item the capacity of edges equals to $1$,thus one certain vertex can be passed at most once and the value of a single path from $s$ to $t$ can only be $1$
	 	\item there exist two edges starting from $s$, and the capacity of each edge is $1$,so the maximum flow value is $2$.According to the conclusion that the value of flow of a single path is $1$, there are two different paths from $s$ to $t$ without intersection
	 \item a path from $s$ to $t$ with a intersection to right or bottom is equivalent to a path from $t$ to $s$ with a direction to top or left. Hence, walking through one of the two path in the flow f in reverse direction, we can get a single path from the top left point to the right bottom point and then return to the top left point with the minimal cost	 
	 \end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Complexity:} \\
	 \begin{itemize}
	 	\item there are $2mn-m$ edges in the graph and $C=1$ ,
		 	so the Ford-Fulkerson costs $O(mn)$ time
		 \item there are $mn$ vertices in the graph, the time complexity of Bellman-Ford algorithm is $O(m^2n^2)$	
		\item the number of possible negative circle is at most $O(mn)$
	 \end{itemize}
	 Hence, the total time complexity is at most $O(m^3n^3)$.
\end{itemize}
