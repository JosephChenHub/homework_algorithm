\section{Longest Consecutive Subsequence}
\textcolor{red}{Oh, I think this problem is Ambiguous,
we can find the similar problem in Leetcode, however its instance like this: given $[1,11,3,5,2]$, the expected answer is $\{1,2,3\}$,	
but Here ,for instance, let $k=3$, there are two answer
\[
	\{1,2,3\}, \{11,3,5,2\}
\]
the first item is obtained according to consecutive number, the second is obtained according to consecutive position.The second condition is easy .
