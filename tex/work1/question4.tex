\section{Divide and Conquer}
\textbf{Question:} \\
Suppose now that youâ€™re given an $n\times n$ grid graph $G$. (An $n\times n$  grid graph is just the adjacency graph of an $n\times n$ chessboard. To be completely precise, it is a graph whose node set is the set of all ordered pairs of natural numbers $(i,j)$, where $1\leq i\leq n$ and $1\leq j \leq n$ ; the nodes $(i,j)$ and $(k,l)$ are joined by an edge if and only if $|i-k| + |j-l| = 1$.) \\
We use some of the terminology of problem 3. Again, each node $v$ is labeled by a real number $x_v$; you may assume that all these labels are distinct. Show how to find a local minimum of $G$ using only $O(n)$ probes to the nodes of $G$. (Note that $G$ has $n^2$ nodes.)
